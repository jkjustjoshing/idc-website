In examining the year in review, this year’s election cycle brought a myriad of new developments, both statewide and locally. These changes significantly impacted the Irondequoit Democratic Committee (IDC) and led to the following actions:

Impact:

- Newly developed congressional and state senate lines through independent redistricting
- Postponement of and Designation of endorsed candidates
- Petitioning for six political campaigns for elected office
- Temporary and permanent appointments of IDC executive board and committee members
- Approval of updated bylaws since 1999
- Administration of a committee member survey
- Adding an IDC prospective member meeting
- Four of six endorsed candidates elected
- Updates to IDC social media including new committee branding

The Irondequoit Democratic Committee’s endless support to assist candidates in winning reelection proved to be effective, as four of their six designated candidates were selected to represent the Irondequoit community. This coordinated campaign effort among all Democratic candidates this year in Monroe County helped to push candidates over the finish line in the final stretch of the election cycle. There were several hard-fought races across the county and state; Monroe County was no exception.

“Our committee members did an outstanding job working with candidates on a myriad of strategies to help support their campaigns,” said Ryan Trevas, Irondequoit Democratic Committee Leader. “These strategies included making phone calls on behalf of candidates, door-to-door interactions with voters, contributing financially to campaigns, hosting lawn signs, and, of course, engaging in early voting as well as responding on Election Day. I am very proud of our committee; our volunteers worked with our candidates in helping them get reelected,” reiterated Trevas.

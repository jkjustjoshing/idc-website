MCDC’s designation process allows its nearly 1,500 elected members on 29 City and Town committees to vote on the party’s endorsed candidates. The process took place over 40 days preceding the Convention, when all local committees hosted designation meetings to nominate and endorse candidates for county, city, and local offices. 

Multiple rounds of voting are possible throughout MCDC’s designation process. Round one consisted of individual committee caucus votes, reported by the leader of each committee. Any candidate who received 50% on this initial ballot was designated. When a position did not have a candidate reach 50%, additional rounds of voting were held, where leaders cast a vote on behalf of their entire committee at their discretion. 

“MCDC is proud to endorse over 55 candidates for local office this year,” said MCDC Chairman Stephen DeVay. “By running for local office, candidates are taking a direct role in building our party and our community. We are living in turbulent times, and by running for office, we build a foundation for progressive ideals and democratic values. We work to ensure that local governments exist to serve their communities, and not the MAGA-style politics we are seeing in D.C. We fight for our local towns, villages, counties and cities – not just to yell into a void, but to work across the board to protect our community, fight for our values, and to do the hard work of governing to ensure we have a future to build toward. 

“I am proud to stand as MCDC Chairman, and with these candidates, as we work to build a stronger Monroe County. Thank you to everyone who is willing to serve in public office. Congratulations to all!”
